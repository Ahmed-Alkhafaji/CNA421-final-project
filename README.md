Design and build a Amazon lex Bot on Amazon Web Services
In this project we will Install and set up  Amazon lex Bot, and this service will allow to build conversations through a text or voice bot based on customer needs, it will increase contact center productivity, and  help to reduce the number of customer service staff. 


• Simplicity – Amazon Lex guides you through using the console to create your own bot in minutes. You supply a few example phrases, and Amazon Lex builds a complete natural language model through which the bot can interact using voice and text to ask questions, get answers, and complete sophisticated tasks.

• Democratized deep learning technologies – Amazon Lex provides ASR and NLU technologies to create a Speech Language Understanding (SLU) system. Through SLU, Amazon Lex takes natural language speech and text input, understands the intent behind the input, and fulfills the user intent by invoking the appropriate business function..

• Seamless deployment and scaling – With Amazon Lex, you can build, test, and deploy your bots directly from the Amazon Lex console. Amazon Lex enables you to publish your voice or text bots for use on mobile devices, web apps, and chat services (for example, Facebook Messenger). Amazon Lex scales automatically. You don’t need to worry about provisioning hardware and managing infrastructure to power your bot experience.

• Built-in integration with the AWS platform – Amazon Lex operates natively with other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudWatch. You can take advantage of the power of the AWS platform for security, monitoring, user authentication, business logic, storage, and mobile app development.

• Cost-effectiveness – With Amazon Lex, there are no upfront costs or minimum fees. You are charged only for the text or speech requests that are made. The pay-as-you-go pricing and the low cost per request make the service a cost-effective way to build conversational interfaces. With the Amazon Lex free tier, you can easily try Amazon Lex without any initial investment.

Amazon Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. Amazon Lex provides the advanced deep learning functionalities of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for converting speech to text, and natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of the text, to enable you to build applications with highly engaging user experiences and lifelike conversational interactions. With Amazon Lex, the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa are now available to any developer, enabling you to quickly and easily build sophisticated, natural language, conversational bots (“chatbots”).
With Amazon Lex, you can build bots to increase contact center productivity, automate simple tasks, and drive operational efficiencies across the enterprise. As a fully managed service, Amazon Lex scales automatically, so you don’t need to worry about managing infrastructure.
